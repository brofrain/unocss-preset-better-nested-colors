# unocss-preset-better-nested-colors

> ðŸŽ­ Colors with pre-defined variants and more

The preset expands customization of theme colors by generating adequate dynamic shortcuts.\
This allows to pre-define both colors and their behavior in certain variations (e.g. `hover`, `focus`, `dark` ).\
The preset also introduces in-config color references and parent color value inheritance, to prevent unnecessary redundation.

_The project is currently more of an experiment with shotgun-style implementation - it still attempts to discover what it really wants to be._

        ":dark": "rgb(250,250,250)",

        interactive: {
          DEFAULT: "~", // inheritance "rgb(50,50,50)"
          ":dark": "~", // inheritance "rgb(250,250,250)"
          ":hover": "accent", // reference to "accent" => "#f00"
        },
      },

      accent: {
        DEFAULT: "#f00",

        interactive: {
          DEFAULT: "~", // inheritance "#f00"

            DEFAULT: "#ff0",
            ":dark": "#f0f",
          },
          ":disabled": "secondary", // reference to "secondary" => "rgb(50,50,50)"
          ":disabled:dark": "secondary:dark", // reference to "secondary" with "dark" variant => "rgb(250,250,250)"
        },
      },

      red: {
        DEFAULT: "red-200", // reference to "red-200" => "#c00"

      green: {

        100: "#0b0",
        200: "~", // inheritance "#0c0"
        300: "#0d0",
        400: "#0e0",
      },
    },
  },
});

Example interactions with the above config:

bg-accent-interactive      =>  bg-[#f00] hover:bg-[#ff0] hover:dark:bg-[#f0f] disabled:bg-[rgb(50,50,50)] disabled:dark:bg-[rgb(250,250,250)]
bg-red                     =>  bg-[#c00]
bg-red-200                 =>  bg-[#c00]
